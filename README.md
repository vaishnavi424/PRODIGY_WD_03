I build a tic-tac-toe web application, you can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. By implementing functions to handle user clicks, track game state, and check for winning conditions, I have created an interactive and engaging tic-tac-toe game. With these technologies and functionalities, users can play against each other  aiming to get three markers in a row to win the game.To view the tic tac toe web application visit https://vaishnavi424.github.io/PRODIGY_WD_03/
